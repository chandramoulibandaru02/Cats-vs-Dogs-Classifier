# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classifier
This is a beginner-friendly image classification project using TensorFlow and Keras.
## 📌 What I did
- Loaded image data using `image_dataset_from_directory`
- Normalized image pixel values
- Visualized sample images with labels using `matplotlib`
- Understood how images and labels are stored and handled in batches

## 🔍 Dataset
- Used the popular **Dogs vs Cats** dataset from Kaggle
- Split into training and validation sets

## 💡 Next Steps
- Build a CNN model
- Train and evaluate the model
- Add data augmentation and performance tuning

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- TensorFlow data pipelines
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Understanding data formats in deep learning
